Fielcoin

1. Incentivized, Decentralized Storage
    - Filecoin, adds an incentive layer to promote long term, verifiable storage on the decentralized web
    - Incentived Storage - storage miners, paid in Filecoin Tokens (FIL)
    - Cryptographic Proofs - storage miners are responsible for proving they are storing the correct data over time
        - Proof of Replication and Proof of Spacetime

2. Preparing and Transferring Data
    - Preparing Data for Storage
        - 1 - Convert file to Filecoin Piece
            - Chunk to IPLD DAG with CID
            - Serialize to Content Addressable Archive
    - Negotiating a Storage Deal and Transferring Data
        - Hire storage miner to store a piece of data
        - Sectors - storage unit
        - Process
            - Create deal proposal
            - Send proposal to miner
            - Miner agrees to store data
            - Send data to miner
            - Miner verifies data
            - Miner publishes deal proposal on Filecoin, committing both parties to the deal

3. Proof of Replication - PoRep
    - PoRep - storage miner proves that they are storing a physically unique copy, or replica, of the data
    - Process
        - Storage miner receievs data and places into sector
        - Once sector is full, a Commitment of Data CommD is produced
        - Sealing
            - Sector data is encoded through a sequence of graph and hasing to create a unique replica
            - Root hash of merkle tree is the Commitment Replica Last CommRLast
            - CommRLast is hashed with CommC to produce CommR, which is then recorded to the blockchain
            - CommRLast is saved for future use in Proof of Spacetime

4. Proof of Spacetime - PoSt
    - Proof of Spacetime is run repeatedly to prove that they are continuing to dedicate storage space to that same data over time
    - Process
        - Run merkle inclusion proofs on random leaf nodes to show miner has specific bytes that shuold be there
        - Miner uses CommRLast to prove they know the root for the replica
        - Proofs are compressed into a single zk-SNARK
        - Miners are required to put down a collateral, if they fail Proof of Spacetime, they are penalized

5. zk-SNARKS
    - Zero Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge
    - Hashes of computations
    - Let us prove a proof has been done correctly without having to reveal the details of the proof itself or the underlying data

6. Verifying Your Deal
    - Key data needed to verify storage is stored on the Filecoin chain, a copy of which is maintained by each user running a node
    - Proof of Spacetime can run regularly over time
    - lotus client list-deals - list all storage deals proposed from that node
    - Deal Structure
        - Deal CID - content identifier for the deal proposal
        - Deal ID - unique ID for the deal
        - Provider - identifier for storage provider with whom the deal was made
        - State - state of the deal (StorageDealActive)
        - On Chain - boolean whether deal is stored on chain
        - Slashed - boolean whether the storage provider has fialed a Proof of Spacetime
        - Piece CID - CID representing the stored data
        - Size - bytes of data
        - Price - price per epocj in Filetoken FIL
        - Duration - total duration of the agreed deal in epochs
    - Requires running our own
